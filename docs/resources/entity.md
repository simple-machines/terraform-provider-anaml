  An Entity is an item in the business domain. Common examples of Entities are:
  CustomersAccountsProductsOrders
  Anything that has a unique identifier and would be useful to report or predict on could be an Entity.
  In a relational database, the identifiers for Entities will often be used for primary keys.
  Tables need to specify one or more columns with entity identifiers in order to be used for Feature definitions.
  Features will be generated for a specific Entity. This means the aggregation will be grouped by each Entity identitifer.
