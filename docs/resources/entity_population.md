  Entity Populations
  An Entity Population allows for the specification of entities and dates to run feature generation for.
  This is used for feature "time travel", as well as generating data for a reduced set of entities.
  An entity population is specified from a table or set of tables using SQL. The entity population must
  return a two column dataset, the first of which is named for the selected entity's output column; and
  the second of which is named "date".
