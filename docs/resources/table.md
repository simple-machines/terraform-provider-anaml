  Tables
  A Table represents a source of data for feature generation. A Table can be one of three types:
  External TableView TablePivot Table
  External tables
  An External Table is the representation of a source table. Therefore you have to specify the
  underlying data sources that the table is stored in.
  View tables
  A View Table is a pre-defined query over one or more other Root Tables or View Tables.
  They function in the same way as views in relational databases. They can be used to transform
  or join tables using arbitary SQL.
  When to use View Tables and when to use Features?
  In general, features should be used wherever possible to transform or aggregate columns as required.
  This allows for better documentation, re-use and collaboration of features as well as allowing
  for better optimise generation runs.
  View Tables are mainly useful for joining data on keys other than entity id's such as reference data lookups.
  Pivot Tables
  Pivot Tables allow features to be re-keyed to different entities.
  This can be very useful, as often in business applications one may have different levels of entity; for example,
  plans and customers. Data may be organised and keyed by plan, and some attributes and campaigns may target plans;
  but also, plans are owned by customers, and when doing analysis on customers, knowing information about their
  plans is crucial.
  Pivot tables help to solve this issue by allowing features which are written for plans to be repurposed at the
  customer level.
  When construcing a pivot table, one needs to specify an entity mapping, which shows how to go from plans to
  customers (this uses a feature query which outputs the customer for a particular plan), and the plan level
  features which are to be aggregated to the customer.
  Usually, the features one writes on a pivot table are simple aggregations, such as number of plans (count) or
  average of some column with some filtering. Day and Row windows are not required.
  Timestamp and Entities
  To be used in feature generation a Table must have one or more Entities and a timestamp associated
  with it. These are needed to be able to join correctly between tables during the feature generation:
  Timestamp - Specifiy the name of the column which contains the timestamp that the row of data was created at.Entities - For each Entity within the Table, specify the name of the column that contains the id's and the
  entity type.
  Note that tables without an Entity and timestamp are still useful for use in View Tables. These are often things
  such as reference data tables used for lookups.

# Tables

A Table represents a source of data for feature generation. A Table can be one of three types:

- External Table
- View Table
- Pivot Table

### External Tables

An External Table is the representation of a source table. Therefore you have to specify the
underlying data sources that the table is stored in.

### View Tables

A View Table is a pre-defined query over one or more other Root Tables or View Tables.
They function in the same way as views in relational databases. They can be used to transform
or join tables using arbitary SQL.

**When to use View Tables and when to use Features?**

In general, features should be used wherever possible to transform or aggregate columns as required.
This allows for better documentation, re-use and collaboration of features as well as allowing
for better optimise generation runs.

View Tables are mainly useful for joining data on keys other than entity id's such as reference data lookups.


### Pivot Tables

Pivot Tables allow features to be re-keyed to different entities.

This can be very useful, as often in business applications one may have different levels of entity; for example,
plans and customers. Data may be organised and keyed by plan, and some attributes and campaigns may target plans;
but also, plans are owned by customers, and when doing analysis on customers, knowing information about their
plans is crucial.

Pivot tables help to solve this issue by allowing features which are written for plans to be repurposed at the
customer level.

When construcing a pivot table, one needs to specify an entity mapping, which shows how to go from plans to
customers (this uses a feature query which outputs the customer for a particular plan), and the plan level
features which are to be aggregated to the customer.

Usually, the features one writes on a pivot table are simple aggregations, such as number of plans (count) or
average of some column with some filtering. Day and Row windows are not required.


## Timestamp and Entities

To be used in feature generation a Table must have one or more [Entities](/entities) and a timestamp associated
with it. These are needed to be able to join correctly between tables during the feature generation:

* **Timestamp** - Specifiy the name of the column which contains the timestamp that the row of data was created at.
* **Entities** - For each Entity within the Table, specify the name of the column that contains the id's and the
entity type.

Note that tables without an Entity and timestamp are still useful for use in View Tables. These are often things
such as reference data tables used for lookups.
