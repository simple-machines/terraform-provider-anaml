  Entity Mappings
  An Entity Mapping is a relationship between one or more Entities so that features can
  automatically be aggregated at different levels without defining the Feature multiple times.
  Each Entity Mapping specifies:
  From Entity - The Entity that the Feature is initially defined onTo Entity - The Entity that can be converted toMapping Feature - A Feature that is defined on the from Entity and has a value of the to Entity.
  For example, given a customer and account Entities where each customer has multiple accounts
  you could define an Entity Mapping from Account to Customer:
  From Entity = AccountTo Entity = CustomerMapping Feature = Last Customer Id for each Account Id

# Entity Mappings

An Entity Mapping is a relationship between one or more Entities so that features can
automatically be aggregated at different levels without defining the Feature multiple times.

Each Entity Mapping specifies:

- From Entity - The Entity that the Feature is initially defined on
- To Entity - The Entity that can be converted to
- Mapping Feature - A Feature that is defined on the *from* Entity and has a value of the *to* Entity.

For example, given a customer and account Entities where each customer has multiple accounts
you could define an Entity Mapping from Account to Customer:

- From Entity = Account
- To Entity = Customer
- Mapping Feature = Last Customer Id for each Account Id
